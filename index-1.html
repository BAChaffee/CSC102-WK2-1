    <p style="color:yellow">
        The ramp drops beneath his feet, a cloud of dust surrounds him as he steps off his ship and down the ramp. It's been a long road, 6 years to be precise, since he's
        been home. Traveling alone, the life of a nomad can be a lonely one at times, stops like this are to be cherished. He dusts himself off as he walks up to the run down facility. 
        He stops to talk to the mechanic about his ship.
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        "Hey, I need fuel." he says in a rough voice brought on by the years of road dust, cigars, and cheap whiskey.
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        The mechanic turns around, it's not a man, but a Taragorian, a human/lizard hybrid being. "How much?"
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        "200 credits"
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        The traveler turns and walks into the saloon. The door is rusted and creaks as it opens. He looks around the room. Dark, gloomy, smells like where hope comes to die, like
        the end of the galaxy should smell. There's a table on the other side of the room where some folks are playing cards. The stage to the right has some...thing...singing in some 
        language he doesn't understand, a man is passed out at the bar, the bar tender is out collecting empty bottles from the tables.
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        "Can I get ya anything stranger?"
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        "Thanks, but what I have is fueling my ship, just looking for some company for a bit before I get back on the road."
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        "I see, well I'll tell ya what, I'll give ya one on me. We don't get many visitors this far out on the rim. What brings you out this far?"
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">    
        "Lookin' for work"
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        "Work? Out here? What fool you been listenin' to? You'd have better luck dropping your last credit on that craps table over there. There ain't been work out this far in generations
        now."
    </p>
    <p style="color:yellow">
        The traveler turns to see the table, the dealer is asleep with empty bottles at his feet. The traveler walks over, nudges the dealer awake and pulls out his last few credits...
